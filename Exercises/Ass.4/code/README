There are three code files:

    1. preprocessing.py - gave us some utils of saving the data examples and the embeding matrix to our data structure of tensors.
    2. model.py - contains the class of our model.
    3. train.py - our main file to run which imports the previous two. Its configured by default to give us the best results.

To run the model with best parameters, all you need to do is to make sure that the data is in the right path: ../data relatively to the code's location.

For running the code, all you need to do is to write in the terminal:
python train.py
